## üìñ Abstract
High-quality 3D assets are essential for various applications in computer graphics and 3D vision but remain scarce due to significant acquisition costs. To address this shortage, we introduce Elevate3D, a novel framework that transforms readily accessible low-quality 3D assets into higher quality. At the core of Elevate3D is HFS-SDEdit, a specialized texture enhancement method that significantly improves texture quality while preserving the appearance and geometry while fixing its degradations. Furthermore, Elevate3D operates in a view-by-view manner, alternating between texture and geometry refinement. Unlike previous methods that have largely overlooked geometry refinement, our framework leverages geometric cues from images refined with HFS-SDEdit by employing state-of-the-art monocular geometry predictors. This approach ensures detailed and accurate geometry that aligns seamlessly with the enhanced texture. Elevate3D outperforms recent competitors by achieving state-of-the-art quality in 3D model refinement, effectively addressing the scarcity of high-quality open-source 3D assets.

To Do
- [ ] Add hugging face demo

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **OS**: Tested only on **Linux**.
- **Hardware**: We recommend using an NVIDIA GPU with at least 48GB of memory due to the requirement of FLUX. The code has been verified on NVIDIA A6000 GPUs.  
- **Software**:   
  - NVIDIA Driver & CUDA Toolkit 12.0 or later.
  - [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/#quick-command-line-install) for environment management.
  - Python version 3.10 or higher

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ryunuri/Elevate3D.git
    cd Elevate3D
    ```

2. Set Up the Environment:
    Create and activate the `elevate3d` conda environment using the provided file.
    ```sh
    conda env create -f environment.yml --name elevate3d
    conda activate elevate3d
    ```
3. Download Models & Dependencies:
    You need to download pre-trained models and build one external dependency.

    __A. Download Checkpoints__:
    Our framework relies on several off-the-shelf models. Some will be downloaded automatically from Hugging Face, but others need to be placed manually.

    ```sh
    # Create directories for checkpoints
    mkdir -p Checkpoints/sam
    
    # Download the Segment Anything Model (SAM) checkpoint
    wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth -P Checkpoints/sam/
    ```

    __B. Build PoissonRecon__:
    The geometry refinement step uses Poisson Surface Reconstruction. You need to build the executable from the source.

    ```sh
    # Clone the PoissonRecon repository
    git clone https://github.com/mkazhdan/PoissonRecon.git
    
    # Navigate and build the executable
    cd PoissonRecon/
    make
    cd ..
    ```

<!-- Usage -->
## üéÆ Usage
Before running, make sure you have downloaded the necessary example data and configured your .yaml file with the correct paths to the checkpoints and PoissonRecon executable.

### üì• Download Example Data

Before running the examples, you need to download the sample 2D images and low-quality 3D models.

1.  **Download the file:** Click the link below to download `Inputs.zip` from Google Drive.
    *   [**Download Example Data (Inputs.zip)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VJmnT2UQKsYuZijGeAuJ0fOeOqkP8nya/view?usp=sharing)

2.  **Unzip the file:** Move the downloaded `Inputs.zip` to the root of this project directory (e.g., `Elevate3D/`). Then, run the following command in your terminal to create an `./Inputs` folder and extract the files into it:

    ```bash
    # Make sure Inputs.zip is in the current project directory
    unzip Inputs.zip
    ```
Before running the examples the directory structure should be like this:

```
Elevate3D/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Checkpoints/                <-- For pre-trained models
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sam/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Inputs/                     <-- Example data you just downloaded
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2D/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 3D/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PoissonRecon/               <-- For geometry processing
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Bin/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Linux/
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PoissonRecon    <-- The compiled executable
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other project files)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### Example 1: 2D Image Refinement (HFS-SDEdit)
An example of using HFS-SDEdit for 2D image refinement.

This runs our texture enhancement module on a single image.

```sh
python -m FLUX.flux_HFS-SDEdit
```

### Example 2: Full 3D Model Refinement
This script runs the complete Elevate3D pipeline on an example model. It will perform iterative texture and geometry refinement.

```sh
bash run_3d_refine_script_example.sh
```

## Running on Your Own Data

The process is broken into two stages: __Data Pre-processing__ and __Model Refinement__.

We will use a sample `knight` model, generated from [TRELLIS](https://github.com/Microsoft/TRELLIS), as a running example.

### __Step 1: Data Pre-processing__

This step takes your input 3D model and prepares it for the refinement stage.

**1. Get the Example Files**: Download the example data from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HofQte_Zo5gpOzQqTKXGDgwg1oke-Olr/view?usp=sharing)

After unzipping, you will have:
*   `knight.glb`: The low-quality input 3D model.
*   `knight.txt`: A text file describing the target appearance.

Organize the inputs as follows:

```sh
# Create the directory structure
mkdir -p Inputs/3D/MyData/knight

# Move the downloaded files into it
mv knight.glb Inputs/3D/MyData/knight
mv knight.txt Inputs/3D/MyData/knight
```

__2. Execute the Pre-processing Script__

Run the provided shell script, passing the path to your object's directory. This script handles model normalization and multi-view rendering.

```sh
bash run_render_script.sh
```

The script will populate your directory with new files.:
```plaintext
Inputs/3D/MyData/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ knight/
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knight_normalized.obj
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prompt.txt
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train_0_0.png
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (many more rendered images)
```
---

### __Step 2: Model Refinement__

Now that the data is ready, you can run the main refinement algorithm. 
Use the following command, ensuring the `dataset` and `obj_name` arguments match the directory structure you just created.

```sh
python main_refactor.py \
  --obj_name="knight" \
  --conf_name="config_my" \
  --bake_mesh \
  --device_idx=0
```
The default `config_my.yaml` provides a good starting point. 
For best results on your own data, we recommend adjusting this configuration for your own dataset.

After the refinement results will be available in `Outputs/3D/MyData/knight`
